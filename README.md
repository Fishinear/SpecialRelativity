# SpecialRelativity

Simple program to visualize the "expanding light sphere" argument of Einstein from Special Relativity. The program takes the events from an expanding light sphere in the stationary reference frame, and shows how that sphere looks like in the moving reference frame, as points in two dimensions, mapping the time parameter to the colour of the point.
